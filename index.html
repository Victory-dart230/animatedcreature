        <h1>Say Hello to BaneBot</h1>
        <p>Meet Banebot and he is a friendly monster until you get on his bad side. He has a very bright red coating with a piercing night vision eye he uses when he is in dark spaces. No matter where he is always has a dark shadow/cast always following, sitting at the very top of his head is a triangular hat that he thinks is snazzy and cool.Lastly he has a second eye that is hidden behind a spinning cube that is attacthed to his head. The purpose of the second is to paralyze enemies whenever they look at it, giving BaneBot the oppourtunity to swoop in and eat them.</p>
